An envdir replacement improved for interactive use.

Runs the given <command> with optional [arguments…] after modifying the
environment using the named environment directories (envdirs).

Named envdirs are found by looking inside "env.d" directories found in the
current directory and upwards in the directory hierarchy.  The search stops
when it hits the filesystem root (/) or $HOME.  If you're within the safety
of your home directory, this ensures you won't pick up env.d directories
potentially outside of your control.  Run "envd --list" from any directory to
see the env.d directories under consideration for that location.

Any <command> must be separated from envdir <name>s by a double hyphen (--).

If no <command> is given, "env" is run which will print the contents of the
environment.
